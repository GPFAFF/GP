    <p><span class="first-character sc">T</span>his page is dedicated to who I am as a person and the journey I have embarked on thus far in my life.  Thank you for reading and if you have any questions please shout.  I wanted to go into detail to show who I am as a person and go beyond the normal "about me" sections.  Albeit long-winded, it is a synopsis of my experiences in my life and that have forged me into the person I am today. In 1982 on a cold March day, I was brought into this world.  Little did I know that what journey I would be heading on but it has been a remarkable one thus far.  Growing up in Cleveland gave me a 7 years of great memories as well as a sports scar that I have carried for all the years of my childhood and adult life.  Being a Cleveland sports fan is pretty much the equivalent of being picked last in every playground game, and having countless amounts of cruel heartbreaks.  Red Right 88, The Drive, The Fumble, The Shot, blowing two world series with one of the most statistically dominant offensive teams in baseball, The Move, The decision and the Browns being the most futile organization known to man.  Such is a day in the life of Cleveland sports.  However it is not all bad.  This has given me the trait of loyalty and patience which I have employed countless times in my life and it has been a skillset that has served me well.  Thanks Cleveland sports.  Who would have thought all that futility would pay off?  Anyways that is my rant on Cleveland sports.  Let's get to the good stuff. </p>

    <p class="margin-top-10">My Father worked in a steel mill and my Mother a Volkswagon dealership, they raised my Brother and I in a small apt in Cleveland.  We lived there for about 8 years before migrating up the Rust Belt to Buffalo.  I have a lot of fantastic memories from my childhood in Cleveland albeit 8 years, it left a significant impression on me.  I still try and go back to Cleveland to see my roots a couple times a year and recant all the fun and relive some of the impressions that great city had made on me.</p>

    <p><span class="first-character ny">B</span>uffalo, NY - 1990.  My father proceeded to get work and move the family to Buffalo.  I spent most of my childhood and early adult life there.  Say what you want about Buffalo, the snow, the economy, or a variety of other jokes - it is a great town.  Still travel back there quite a bit.  I met a lot of my friends whom I still keep in contact with today.  I ended up going to school at the University of Bufffalo studying Psychology and Political Science.  My original plan was going to law school however sometimes plans don't work out like they're supposed to.  During college I delieverd pizza and was a bartender, during that time I put myself through college and after the time to go to lawschool came i decided against it. Instead I did the radical thing, I packed up my 1994 Nissan Sentra with 250,000 miles on it and moved to Los Angeles. </p>
    <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">Buffalo didn't have the greatest job econmoy.  This prompted me to open my living options and having only lived amongst the Great Lakes, I opted for sunshine and relaxation. Having a network out there and being a fresh start it was very appealing. It was a very tough move leaving family behind and the secuirty which I found in Buffalo but it turned out to be the greatest move I could have made and ended up shaping my professional career greatly.</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p><span class="first-character atw">I</span> moved out to Los Angeles in 2006 and ended up falling into a technology recruiting role.  Here is where my life transformed.  Being only armed with the ability to navigate the internet and send emails it was a rough learning curve but having a great work ethic I dove head first into web development. My first real office job out of college was in a very "boiler room" type environment where it was sink or swim.  I was a sponge learning everything I could about different technologies, enviroments, startups, etc.  </p>
    <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">This sales type environment helped me learn quickly as time was of the essence but lead me to realize I was looking for more of brand building opportunity than a transactional business.  I then moved on to a start-up company where I ran a full desk tech recruiting and handling the accounts that I brought on.  There came a time where I realized that I wanted to work in a dual capacity and that opportunity would come later in my career.  Learning how to code would be something that I would need to embark on. </p>

    <p><span class="first-character atw">C</span>hicago - Present Day.  I moved to Chicago in 2011.  Packed up my car and decided to move back to the Great Lakes.  Chicago is a fantatsic city gives me everything I need in terms of business and people.  I have been working for Razorfish since I moved to Chicago specializing in placing engineers in all of Razorfish' offices across the country.  This has been an excellent opportunity and I have worked with tons of excellent people.  Razorfish has given me an opportunity to do what I am passionate about.  Build a brand, be an amabassador and contiune to grow my skill set.  Having being engrained in technology for the last 7 years, it has beena very smooth transition.  Razorfish has also given me the opportunity to work on web development projects. I am currently working there in two capacities.  As a Senior Recruiter and also as Front End Developer for Razorfish, the ability to work on both is something that I really enjoy.  I am working on HTML5, CSS and JavaScript for a variety of different clients within Razorfish.</p>
    <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">In search to futher my knowledge in technology.  I partnered up with 1871 and Starter League and started taking Front End classes.  This gave me the basic knowledge and lit the fuse in my never end thirst for knowledge.  I love this world becasue its so fluid and there is so much to learn. Technology evolves so fast and its hard to keep up.  I try and engrain myself into the tech world by trying to teach myself as much as possible and network with any developer or engineer that I speak to.  This industry is fantasctic and it will help you any way it can.  That being said I would love to hear from you.  If you're interested in chatting with me or if you are interested in working toegther I'd love to hear from you.  If you are looking to chat with me about potentially working at Razorfish, please reach out.  Hope to hear from you soon!</p>
