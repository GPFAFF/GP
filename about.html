    <p><span class="first-character sc">T</span>his page is dedicated to who I am as a person and the journey I have embarked on thus far in my life.  Thank you for reading and if you have any questions please shout.  In 1982 on a cold March day, I was brought into this world.  Little did I know that what journey I would be heading on but it has been a remarkable one thus far.  Growing up in Cleveland gave me a 7 years of great memories as well as a sports scar that I have carried for all the years of my childhood and adult life.  Being a Cleveland sports fan is pretty much the equivalent of being picked last in every playground game, and having countless amounts of cruel heartbreaks.  Red Right 88, The Drive, The Fumble, The Shot, blowing two world series with one of the most statistically dominant offensive teams in baseball, The Move, The decision and the Browns being the most futile organization known to man.  Such is a day in the life of Cleveland sports.  However it is not all bad.  This has given me the trait of loyalty and patience which I have employed countless times in my life and it has been a skillset that has served me well.  Thanks Cleveland sports.  Who would have thought all that futility would pay off?  Anyways that is my rant on Cleveland sports.  Let's get to the good stuff. </p>

    <p class="margin-top-10">My Father worked in a steel mill and my Mother a Volkswagon dealership, they raised my Brother and I in a small apt in Cleveland.  We lived there for about 8 years before migrating up the Rust Belt to Buffalo.  I have a lot of fantastic memories from my childhood in Cleveland albeit 8 years, it left a significant impression on me.  I still try and go back to Cleveland to see my roots a couple times a year and recant all the fun and relive some of the impressions that great city had made on me.</p>

    <p><span class="first-character ny">B</span>uffalo, NY - 1990.  My father proceeded to get work and move the family to Buffalo.  I spent most of my childhood and early adult life there.  Say what you want about Buffalo, the snow, the economy, or a variety of other jokes - it is a great town.  Still travel back there quite a bit.  I met a lot of my friends whom I still keep in contact with today.  I ended up going to school at the University of Bufffalo studying Psychology and Political Science.  My original plan was going to law school however sometimes plans don't work out like they're supposed to.  During college I delieverd pizza and was a bartender, during that time I put myself through college and after the time to go to lawschool came i decided against it. Instead I did the radical thing, I packed up my 1994 Nissan Sentra with 250,000 miles on it and moved to Los Angeles. </p>

    <p class="margin-top-10">Buffalo didn't have the greatest job econmoy.  This prompted me to open my living options and having only lived amongst the Great Lakes, I opted for sunshine and relaxation. Having a network out there and being a fresh start it was very appealing. It was a very tough move leaving family behind and the secuirty which I found in Buffalo but it turned out to be the greatest move I could have made and ended up shaping my professional career greatly.</p>

    <p><span class="first-character atw">I</span> moved out to Los Angeles in 2006 and ended up falling into a technology recruiting role.  Here is where my life transformed.  Being only armed with the ability to navigate the internet and send emails it was a rough learning curve but having a great work ethic I dove head first into web development. My first real office job out of college was in a very "boiler room" type environment where it was sink or swim.  I was a sponge learning everything I could about different technologies, enviroments, startups, etc.  </p>
